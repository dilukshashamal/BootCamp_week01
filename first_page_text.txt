ABSTRACT IoT is becoming more common and popular due to its wide range of applications in various
domains. They collect data from the real environment and transfer it over the networks. There are many
challenges while deploying IoT in a real-world, varying from tiny sensors to servers. Security is considered
as the number one challenge in IoT deployments, as most of the IoT devices are physically accessible in
the real world and many of them are limited in resources (such as energy, memory, processing power and
even physical space). In this paper, we are focusing on these resource-constrained IoT devices (such as
RFID tags, sensors, smart cards, etc.) as securing them in such circumstances is a challenging task. The
communication from such devices can be secured by a mean of lightweight cryptography, a lighter version
of cryptography. More than ﬁfty lightweight cryptography (plain encryption) algorithms are available in
the market with a focus on a speciﬁc application(s), and another 57 algorithms have been submitted by the
researchers to the NIST competition recently. To provide a holistic view of the area, in this paper, we have
compared the existing algorithms in terms of implementation cost, hardware and software performances and
attack resistance properties. Also, we have discussed the demand and a direction for new research in the area
of lightweight cryptography to optimize balance amongst cost, performance and security.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. IoT OVERVIEW
Internet of Things (IoT) has already become a dominant
research era because of its applications in various domains
such as smart transport & logistics, smart healthcare, smart
environment, smart infrastructure (smart cities, smart homes,
smart ofﬁces, smart malls, Industry 4.0), smart agriculture
and many more. Many researchers and industry experts have
given various deﬁnitions of IoT depending on their applica-
tions and implementation area, but in simple words, IoT is
a network of connected things, each with a unique identiﬁ-
cation, able to collect and exchange data over the Internet
with or without human interaction [1]–[5]. In any IoT solution
or application, IoT devices are the key elements. These IoT
devices could be divided into two main categories (Figure 1):

rich in resources such as servers, personal computers, tablets
and smartphones, etc. and limited in resources (resource-
constrained) such as industrial sensors or sensor nodes, RFID
tags, actuators, etc., [6]. In this paper, we focus on the second
category of IoT devices. These connected devices are becom-
ing more popular due to their use in various application and
will ﬂood the market with the emergence of IoT [6], leading
an enormous data exchange rate amongst [7].
